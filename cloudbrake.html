										<h3> CloudBrake, funded by the ERC, strives to expose the coupling of clouds and the vertical structure of wind, thereby aiding </br>
										development of parameterizations for improved numerical weather prediction, climate modeling, and wind energy design. </h3>
									</header>
									<p>To study the causality behind relationships between clouds and wind in tropical and midlatitude weather systems, 
									CloudBrake combines high-resolution modeling with the analysis of measurements from ground
									and from aircraft. New lidar techniques aboard aircraft are exploited to collect high-resolution 
									wind profiles and turbulence data, and to validate low-level winds measured by the wind lidar aboard ESA's Aeolus satellite, launched in 2018. 
									By combining Aeolus data with space-borne remote sensing of clouds and rain, we can trace evidence of a coupling between winds and clouds on global scales. 
									New insights obtained by CloudBrake will be used to constrain models of momentum transport by shallow convection, and the impact of momentum 
									transport on circulations will be tested in a general circulation model.									
									Read more about the research strategy and the scientific background below. </p>

									<p>
									<strong>1. Small-scale processes:</strong></br>
									Ground-based and (existing) airborne measurements will expose relationships between the
									structure of winds, shallow convection and cloudiness. Furthermore, Large-Eddy Simulation
									(LES) of tropical and mid-latitude cases will systematically explore the role of different wind profiles (shear) and convective
									organization on convective momentum transport.</p>
									<p><strong>2. New data & techniques:</strong></br>
									A flight campaign with DLR's Falcon aircraft carrying the ADM Aeolus demonstrator
									(A2D) lidar and the 2 μm Doppler wind lidar (DWL) will validate space-borne Aeolus
									measurements of winds at low levels (< 5 km) for different convective states of the atmosphere. 
									Momentum fluxes at 100 Hz are measured using in-situ sensors
									of wind, which inform relationships between wind and momentum transport.</p>
									<p><strong>3. Conceptualization:</strong></br>
									Constraints and boundaries on the influence of convective momentum transport on the
									momentum budget are evaluated using high resolution simulations in idealized settings (LES)
									and high resolution simulations in realistic settings (hind-casts over the tropical Atlantic
									and LES run in forecast modes). Existing treatments of momentum
									transport by cumulus parameterizations are re-examined.</p>
									<p><strong>4. Large-scale circulation:</strong></br>
									In collaboration with climate modeling institutes and NWP centers general circulation models 
									are used to study the influence of
									different representations of convective momentum transport on wind patterns and the large-scale
									circulation As an outlook, this can be explored in more complex
									settings in CMIP models. Satellite remote sensing (including Aeolus) will be used to look for
									traces of interactions between shallow cumuli and large-scale winds in phases of strong and weak
									circulations (ENSO). </p>

									<p> For many centuries clouds have informed us how and where the winds are blowing. Even today, 
									satellite observations of clouds are assimilated in numerical weather prediction models to improve the prediction of wind patterns.
									But clouds may not just simply drift along with the mean wind: they can modulate winds themselves. 
									One way to do so is by transporting air with a certain momentum (wind speed) away from the surface 
									to higher levels in the atmosphere, and transporting air with a different momentum from higher levels to the surface.
									This vertical mixing of clouds can influence the vertical profile of wind, and CloudBrake postulates
									that this process is critical for larger-scale circulations (Fig. 1). </p>
									
									<p>The focus of CloudBrake is on shallow convective clouds. Momentum transport by shallow clouds is 
									studied even less than that for deeper clouds, yet shallow clouds dominate the subtropical and tropical oceans 
									(between 5º - 30º north and south of the Equator) in regions that are known for their strong near-surface easterly winds: the trades. 
									The trade-winds are important because they define convergence patterns in the tropics, where the ascending
									branch of the Hadley circulation produces the majority of tropical rainfall (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the trade-winds modulate ocean
									currents and upwelling, sea surface temperatures and turbulent fluxes at the ocean surface. Because the
									trade-winds are not only strong, but also relatively steady, they have a large (unexploited) wind energy potential.  
									Shallow clouds are also frequent in the mid-latitudes as part of storm systems (frontal systems and cold air outbreaks)
									or during fair-weather conditions (spring and summer days).</p>
									
									<p> The coupling of clouds to winds (circulations) has been highlighted by the World Climate Research Program as a 
									<a href="https://www.wcrp-climate.org/grand-challenges/gc-clouds">Grand Challenge</a> for developing a better understanding 
									of the Earth System and its sensitivity to global warming. This coupling may occur through the interactions of clouds with 
									temperature, moisture and radiative fluxes, but also more directly through momentum transport. The goal of CloudBrake is 
									to better understand such dynamical motions that also define convection and clouds, and which have received relatively little attention
									since pioneering studies in the trades, in which clouds were always viewed in light of changes in the profile of horizontal wind (Fig.2). </p>
