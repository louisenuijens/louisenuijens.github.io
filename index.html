I am an assistant professor in the Department of Geosciences & Remote Sensing at Delft Technical University. 
My research focuses on convection and clouds, and their role in the Earth system. Specific research topics that I work on are:
convective momentum transport (see also CloudBrake), tropical circulations, cloud systems in the trades, and precipitation from warm clouds.
